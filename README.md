Projects

House price prediction

Description

House price prediction using machine learning involves developing a model that estimates the value of a house based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and neighborhood amenities. By analyzing historical data, machine learning algorithms identify patterns and relationships between these features and house prices, enabling accurate and data-driven predictions. Common algorithms used include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting models like XGBoost. This approach is widely used in real estate for market analysis, pricing strategy, and decision-making, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional methods.
